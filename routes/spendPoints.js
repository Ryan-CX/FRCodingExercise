//setup the spend points routeï¼Œthe rules are following:
//1. The route takes 1 parameter which is the total points to spend in the format of {"points":points}
//2. The route returns the payer and the points that the payer spent from the payableBalance database. For example, if the payer has a payableBalance of 100, and the total points to spend is 50, the route returns the payer and -50 points. If the total point to spend is greater than the current payableBalance, the route returns the payer and the negative current payableBalance, and the payableBalance is set to 0.
//3. After the spent from each payer, update the payableBalance database.
//4. The expected response is a json object with the payer and the points spent from the payableBalance database.
//5. Add error handling for the route.
